# Life_Expectancy_vs_GDP_Project

This is a project I worked on while learning Python on Codecademy. 

I was tasked with creating loops to run through the csv file and create different plots based on the data in the all_data.csv 

The data includes six different countries with their life expectancy and the countries GDP spanning from 2000 to 2015. I then created and added the data to lists and was then able to use them in my loops in creating different visuals.
